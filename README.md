# About Me

Welcome to my Profile - nice to meet you!   


## Why does a Recruiter have a GitHub profile? Because I am going to be a Data Scientist!

Normally I introduce myself with the following .. 

I am an experienced HR professional with 9+ years of experience in international environments. 
I started my career as a generalist to afterwards specialize in the field of Talent Acquisition (Recruiting & Employer Branding). 

For example I worked in the fast-paced industries of Gaming & E-Commerce - going through digitalization challenges. As part of HR, I like to encourage and support those changes. But I often see a big gap between HR and digitalization and especially the transformative potential of HR-Analytics is not recognised. Intrinsically motivated and based on my interests - I am currently part of the Data Science Bootcamp of [neue fische.](https://www.neuefische.de/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwy8f6BRC7ARIsAPIXOjg2z_2VmVERTAiLm3-bUEoQF5hzd6_Xa4nG-3HbauedCsUIFwnihhkaAv6CEALw_wcB)


## To pick up the ball again - in the future I would like to introduce myself as follows:

I am an experienced HR professional and a Data Scientist. 

In September 2020 I started my journey to explore the world of e.g. data mining, data cleaning, data exploration .. as well as pair programming, reviews, daily stand ups and a final capstone project. I am trying to figure out how I can initiate changes and be part of it. Especially interested in the HR-Analytics environment - I am curios to take a deep dive into the world of Data Science. Showing the world that Recruiters are not only annoying and like google says [„a waste of time“](https://www.recruiterly.com/blog/8-things-google-says-recruiters-are-and-8-things-they-actually-are/.) ;-) I am sure it won't be an easy way but where there’s no will, there’s no way - and motivation makes things happen. Who knows - maybe I can motivate others to keep an eye on Data Science in HR.
